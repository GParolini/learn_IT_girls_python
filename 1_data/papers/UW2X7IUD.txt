Ah, bitter chill it was! The owl, for all his feathers was a-cold; The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass; And silent was the flock in woolly fold: T H E contrast between the effects of external cold upon the two kingdoms of living things suggested in this shivering picture is a characteristic one. The animal suffers the sensation of cold, but protects itself from actually freezing by greater heat-producing metabolism, within non-conducting coverings; while the plant, which has no such adaptations, cools down pari passu with the environment, and freezes solid. In our comfortable conviction that the plant, in so doing, suffers no agony of cold we may reserve our sympathies for our nearer brethren, but it will be a not unseasonable enquiry to consider in a general way the relation of plant-vitality to such low temperatures as occur normally in the winter months. I propose in this article, therefore, to give some account of the present state of our knowledge on this matter, which was materially advanced, not long ago, by the publication of the detailed results of Lidforss' investigations on the plants that remain green through the winter (the " winter-green " flora) in South Sweden. A critical account of the earlier literature upon the subject does not come within the scope of this article and we will begin with the pamphlet published by Molisch a dozen years ago and then pass to the work of Mez, 1905; Gorke, 1906; and Lidforss, 1907. The various works by Muller-Thurgau on this subject are of great importance, but published in 1880, 1882 and 1886, they are hardly recent enough for detailed notice. The well established fact that Yeast, Bacteria, and some moulds can withstand prolonged exposure to the cold of liquid hydrogen, teaches us that there is no primary essential injurious effect in chilling protoplasm. Nevertheless most sappy parts of the higher plants are killed by cooling much below O °C. We have to enquire what this injurious indirect effect of cold may be and why some plants are so much more resistant than others. One general secondary effect of cold is the formation of ice within the tissues of the plant, and another is alteration of the balance of the chemical changes that are going on in the cells. As a tertiary effect we have the dessication that results on withdrawing water as solid ice and this again might give rise to a quaternary class of effects due to the very concentrated solutions of the cell-constituents in which the protoplasm would be bathed in a partly frozen cell. To Molisch we owe the first direct observations, with microscope and freezing mixture, of the formation of ice in plants. He noticed that in the living plant ice-formation does not always take place immediately the temperature has fallen to the freezing point of the sap, which of course is below zero just in proportion to the amount of dissolved substances in it. Indeed he found a good parallel with the phenomena observed on freezing salt-solutions in general. Thus just as drops of water suspended in olive oil may be over- cooled many degrees below zero without ice-formation, till suddenly they solidify completely and the temperature rises to the true freezing point of water, so the hairs of Tradescantia stamens may be cooled to —6.5 °C and then suddenly the cells fill with crystals of ice. Further as water in a fine capillary tube .3 mm. diameter resists freezing till it has been over-cooled to —10 °C so the capillary mycelium of Phycomyces may, in air, be cooled to —17 °C before ice is formed in it. It is exceptional for ice to form inside cells, and on cooling cells mounted in water, the outside water freezes first and then water is gradually withdrawn from within the cell to form more ice on the outside of the cell-wall. A filament of Spirogyra when frozen in this way is so shrunken, that under the microscope it looks exactly like a shrivelled dried-up thread. When tissues of higher plants are frozen, films of pure ice form on the walls abutting on inter-cellular spaces, and these films grow steadily to quite large lumps of ice causing disruption of the tissues. Muller-Thurgau and Molisch held that the fatal effect of this freezing should be traced to the resulting dessication of the proto-plasm whereby its structure was irrecoverably disorganised. As long as the ice-formation is staved off in sappy plants the cold does not kill. For sudden death on cooling ice-formation is essential, whether it acts as Molisch suggests straight upon the protoplasm, or only indirectly. The reverse is, of course, not at all true, as many plants recover readily after being frozen solid. Dominant by the authority of Sachs the erroneous view had long been held that it is only on the thawing of the cell that the fatal disorganisation sets in, and that if thawing proceeds very slowly recovery may take place which would not be attained with quick thawing. Molisch has ingeniously and finally demonstrated the complete incorrectness of these views. He cooled the red marine Alga Nitophyllum to —5 °C when it froze and on keeping it frozen the brilliant orange red fluorescence of the phycoerythrin in the cell soon became very obvious. In the living cell the pigment exhibits no fluorescence and this appearance is a sure sign of death. By similar treatment of the leaves of Ageratum mexicanum the odour of coumarin was soon developed, without any thawing having taken place, and this odour, which results from post-mortem ferment action within the cell, is also evidence of the death of the cell. Definite experiments made with a number of plants showed that only in one exceptional case, Agave, did the rate of thawing make any difference to the question of death or recovery. In 1905, Mez developed a different point of view. He thinks that death by "cold-dessication" is only exceptional, perhaps true only for water-plants and holds that protoplasm is directly susceptible to cold and that there is for each cell a fatal "minimum" temperature. Further, for plants which can stand the formation of ice in their tissues he thinks it is an advantage that in a cold environment (he worked with —14.5 °C experimentally) the ice should form as quickly as possible. The protective action of the ice lies in this, that conduction away of the plant-heat is not half as quick in solid ice as it is in a liquid or watery tissue. Consequently the inner parts are much longer in cooling to their fatal minimum. The formation of ice from sap in tissues leads to the liberation of the latent heat of the water and crystallising out of sugar from the sap would also generate heat. If these radiations were adequately isolated by non-conductors from the outside cold, the delay in cooling down to the minimum might be very considerable. Mez holds that the storing-up of sugars in the periderm of trees and in evergreen leaves (cf. Lidforss) is a preparation of substances which will give out a little protective warmth when concentrated to crystallisation by ice-formation. It is clear that these principles must be at work in the plant, but it is difficult to determine the magnitude of their biological significance. Mez shows clearly that when a sappy piece of tissue (he used largely the nodes of stems of Impatiens) is cooled down and its internal temperature registered by an imbedded thermo-junction it goes through the same phases as a solution of its constituent substances would. The falling temperature on cooling passes through a phase of separation of pure ice into a phase where the solutes have become so concentrated that they and the ice crystallise out at an equal rate. During this phase the temperature remains constant and only when it is over and the whole mass is frozen solid does the temperature once more fall. According to Mez this freezing temperature was never observed to be below —6 °C, so that in time "cold-dessication" should be complete at this temperature and the protoplasm should not suffer any more by further cooling, on the hypothesis that all the injury is simply due to dessication. This clearly goes against the view of Muller-Thurgau and Molisch, and we shall see in the work of Gorke that there are other ways in which withdrawal of water may injure the protoplasm besides direct dessication. In 1906, Gorke made experiments on changes in composition produced by freezing, either whole plants or their expressed sap, which brought to light a quite new factor. It is well known that the natural proteids can, by the addition of concentrated neutral salts to solutions of them, be "salted out" as precipitates, which at first can be redissolved on dilution but on standing become insoluble and "denatured." It occurred to Gorke that when the plant is frozen and water is withdrawn from the cell, the salts present must become more concentrated and might well in time act on the soluble proteids of the cell and cause their precipitation. This expectation was realised and he found that barley which has been put out at —7 °C for a night and been frozen solid, yields, on expression of its sap after thawing, a juice which contains only 2/3 of the amount of proteid in solution which the expressed sap of the unfrozen control culture of barley yielded. He went further and showed that the low temperature required to precipitate proteid from the expressed sap of different normal plants varied considerably; that it was mild in the case of those plants that suffered severely from cold, but that a very low temperature was required in the case of very resistant plants. Thus the freshly expressed sap of Begonia or Pelargonium (which are easily injured at —5 °C) yields a denatured precipitate of proteid at —3 °C, in time, while winter-rye is only precipitated at —15 °C and the sap of Pine needles not until —40 °C. The production of this effect will of course vary with the nature of the proteids present and also with the nature and amount of the salts present in addition. Gorke made up solutions of egg-albumin with mixtures of salts like those in the cell and found that after freezing to —20 °C there was a large and permanent precipitate. All this work deals with the soluble proteids of the cell, but one may reasonably transfer the idea to the structural proteids of protoplasm to account for the killing effect. It had been previously observed that on lowering the temperature of solutions of certain acids like tribasic phosphoric acid, the acidity slightly increases, so that more alkali is required to neutralise it, and that therefore a mixture with alkali, neutral at ordinary temperatures, would develop acidity on cooling. Gorke found that the sap of plants also shows an increased acidity on cooling, which would of course help in precipitation and denaturation of proteids at low temperatures. We will now pass to Lidforss' work on his Swedish winter-green flora. The plants which in mid-winter are to be found still bearing green leaves belong to a variety of ecological types. None of these appears to show any obvious adaptation for protection from winter cold, and perhaps the most interesting are those delicate herbaceous annuals which look so unfitted for winter existence — Holosteum, Cerastium, Lamium, Veronica, Senecio, Viola, Fumaria, etc. Even in the Arctic flora there is nothing protective to compete with the snug coatings of our feathered, furred and fleecy friends and Kjellman concluded that protection from injury by frost must lie in the nature of the protoplasm. Lidforss has, however, established one general characteristic of all these plants in winter-time which does seem clearly to be protective. He finds that all winter-green leaves are quite free from starch but contain quantities of sugar (and sometimes oil) in the mesophyll. In the summer these same leaves contain abundant starch. This they regenerate in spring and if the plants are brought from the open into a warm room in mid-winter, starch is also usually soon regenerated from the sugar. The only exceptions which Lidforss found were the submerged water-plants like Elodea, Chara, which show starch all through the winter. The rule obviously does not break down on proof by the exception, for submerged plants are in an environment which will not fall below zero. Few of these winter-plants belong to Stahl's saccharophyllous class characterised by general absence of starch-formation, low transpiration rates and tolerance of dry soil, which lowness of transpiration is held to be a direct result of the high sugar-content of the evaporating sap of the mesophyll cells. In winter all soil is physiologically dry and the sugar might help to keep down the transpiration and avoid the evils of wilting, but Lidforss finds a much more direct advantage in its presence. He first demonstrated that the sugar in the cells does enable them to survive a lower temperature. This can be proved by the simple preliminary treatment of keeping cut leaves with their stalks in sugar solution (5-10% of any ordinary sugar) for a few days. Nerium and Viburnum Tinus are particularly good at taking up sugar in this way without becoming at all wilted. When these sugared leaves are exposed to a frost of —7 °C they remain uninjured, while controls that had been kept preliminarily alongside them in water are killed and show this by turning quickly brown by post-mortem oxidative changes. Most leaves exhibit this protective action of sugar more or less, the real difficulty is to get the sugar into the mesophyll cells. Not only leaves but seedlings of Helianthus, and roots of Vicia can be protected by intake of sugar. The last named material after 18 hours in 5% levulose survived four hours, frozen at —2 °C, while roots without sugar were all killed. Water plants fall into two sharply marked classes in this connection. Elodea, Chara, and Stratiotes, which in winter vegetate at the bottom of streams at a temperature just above zero, contain starch but no sugar and are killed on exposure to —2 °C or —4 °C. In contrast to these we find at the edge of the stream the submerged wintering stumps of the plants which vegetated above the water in the summer, such as Menyanthes, Ranunculus lingua, Myosotis, Sium. These have all converted their starch to sugar for the winter and in correlation it is found that a temperature of —7 °C is required to kill them. Another phenomenon which seems to be explained by Lidforss' work is the puzzling fact that many a plant which has survived the profound and prolonged cold of winter may be killed by a sharp night-frost in early spring (long before, of course, it has started any new growth). This is especially common when the night-frost is preceded by a spell of bright sunny radiation. The accepted explanation is that it is the quick change of temperature from warm day to cold night that injures, but all experimenters agree now that the rate of cooling or thawing makes very little difference. Lidforss finds that a succession of warm days in spring causes the regeneration of starch and holds that it is the disappearance of the protective sugar that makes the plant more susceptible. This is borne out by his observations that it is the well-sunned south side of trees like Ilex and Taxus that suffer in such weather and that here the sugar has gone, while the shaded north side of the tree still keeps its sugar and is uninjured by the spring frost. In Holosteum umbellatum a warm January day with a temperature of +5 °C starts the regeneration of starch and if a cold spell follows, it may revert to sugar. Warming up a leaf in a greenhouse for a week when, as sometimes happens in the early winter, it can be done without an appreciable fall in the sugar content, does not make the leaf more susceptible to cold, so that clearly it is not the direct effect of warmth that matters. In South Sweden the starch of vegetation gives place to sugar, rather quickly, in November, and remains thus till early or middle April when the reverse change takes place, but there the winter is more prolonged than in our climate. This brings us to Lidforss' theory of the protective action of sugar. It is simply this, that the presence of sugar retards the salting-out effect investigated by Gorke. Spiro had found that the presence of non-electrolytes, like alcohol, glycerine, sugars, etc., hinders the coagulation of proteids, and that indeed the presence of sugar may raise the heat-coagulation point of a given proteid from 59 °C to 85 °C. Lidforss found by experiment that the addition of 5% to a mixture of egg-albumen and dilute Knop's nutritive salt-solution much diminished the amount of proteid precipitate that ensued on freezing, and that 10% sugar prevented altogether such precipitation. Combining this with Gorke's experiments on freezing whole plants and actual expressed sap, it seems safe to transfer these effects observed in vitro to the living cell, and to accept this theory that the universal formation of sugar in winter-leaves acts as a distinct protection against winter cold. To prevent our deriving too great satisfaction from this interesting chain of reasoning, we may recall that two characteristic sugar-plants, the sugar-cane and the sugar-beet are both very susceptible to cold and that sugarless Bacteria on the contrary are very resistant. Of course the constitution or composition of the protoplasm will have the final word in this matter. We may now attempt to carry our enquiry a stage further and ask how it comes about that winter-leaves convert their starch to sugar. This phenomenon is not confined to leaves, but Russow and Fischer found that in most trees the periderm of the trunk contains sugar and oil in winter, in place of the starch present in summer. Potato tubers too kept at temperatures near zero are well known to turn sweet and unpalatable This interesting phenomenon was worked at with great insight and precision by Muller-Thurgau as long ago as 1882. He first shewed that sugar formation was not the result of injury by frost and that indeed it does not take place when the tuber is kept frozen hard, below —1 °C. At 0 °C the conversion of starch to sugar proceeds steadily, and potatoes stored upon ice may go on accumulating sugar for forty or fifty days. The accumulation begins slowly, and then proceeds faster and faster for a time, till it reaches somewhere about 3% of the fresh weight. Then the increase stops and the sugar content is maintained at about that amount. This we should consider as the result of the accumulation of the products of diastatic hydrolysis of starch hindering the further progress of the reaction (to speak statically). That the limit attained depends on the concentration of the sugar Muller showed by cooling potatoes which had been caused first to lose a lot of water by slow drying. These potatoes formed sugar to about the same concentration, and therefore to a less absolute amount than watery turgid tubers. If potatoes are kept at +3° the sugar content does not rise above -.5%, while at +6 °C hardly a trace of sugar is to be found. This phenomenon is then essentially a disturbance of metabolic balance due to low temperature. The amount of sugar at any moment depends partly on the diastatic activity and partly on the consumption of the sugar in respiration. As the temperature falls, the respiration will be much diminished, and this favours the accumulation of sugar. Diastatic activity is also diminished by cold, but the equilibrium point finally attained between starch and sugar is shifted towards the sugar by cold. Equilibrium points of reversible reactions are always shifted with fall of temperature in the direction of a greater concentration of the products of the exothermic direction of the reaction; that is, in this case, a greater concentration of sugar. On warming a sugary potato to 20 °C the sugar rapidly disappears, an increased portion of it is respired, and the rest reconverted to starch by another shifting of the equilibrium point, now in the opposite direction. We must not follow Muller's attempt to consider these factors quantitatively, but it is of interest that the balance of starch and sugar in these living cells of tubers, tree-trunks or winter-green leaves alters with temperature according to an established thermo-dynamical law. We cannot yet say to what extent physiological processes or biological adaptations are superposed upon this fundamental principle to produce so great an accumulation as to act as a satisfactory protection against winter frost.
