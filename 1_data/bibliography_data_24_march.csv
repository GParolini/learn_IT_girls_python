No formal meetings could be held because the members were so widely scattered, but suggestions were obtained by correspondence on the proper function of the Committee. Certain concrete research projects were proposed, as well as suggestions of a more general nature. It was agreed that the Committee should undertake to summarize, insofar as its limited facilities permitted, the progress of climatology in the United States during the year. This first report is admittedly incomplete. Comments of the members of the Committee follow.","1949","2018-08-06 14:13:42","2019-03-21 22:00:36","","439-443","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","English","©1949. American Geophysical Union.

To an extent never before approached, it was a war of technician versus technician. Particularly is this true of the technical use of weather. Weather has always been a potent weapon in warfare. History tells us that battles and sometimes even wars have been lost because weather aligned itself with the enemy. In this war, the intelligent exploitation of some single weather factor often supplied the slight technical advantage which meant the difference between success or failure of an operation or campaign. But the attainment of that technical advantage meant continuous and detailed long-range planning which in turn meant that it was impossible for the military planner to wait for a short-range forecast before incorporating the important weather factor into his plans. Weather planning on an equally long-range basis was the only answer and, to the meteorologist, that meant climatology. But not the climatology he knew in 1941.","1947","2018-08-16 12:37:38","2019-03-24 09:49:02","2018-08-16 12:37:38","","52","","1","","","","Meteorological Monographs","1","","","American Meteorological Society","Boston","English","","","+ WB 00320","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-1-935704-86-7_1","","","","Book; Jacobs, W.

The quantity available for the needs of the plant depends on the intensity of the rain, the soil's retention capacity for the water and the amount of evaporation.It has long been recognized that moisture can rise to the surface of the soil by capillarity or distillation; likewise, the fog in the country cold and damp and the dew in the warm regions are secondary sources of moisture that must not be neglected.The phenomena of adsorption (fixation of the water vapor of the air, without the latter being saturated) are to be considered particularly, because, at least in the Mediterranean region, the water thus fixed by hygroscopicity can fluid and therfore usable by plants.The author created a test sensor (see above) which shows how much water can be collected by these processes.","1933","2018-09-11 12:47:45","2019-03-23 23:51:12","","359","","","","","","","","","","","","","French","","","","","","","","","","","France; Report/Proceedings; Central Experimental Station for Agricultural Physics and Climatology; Chaptal, L.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
