It is well-known that in vegetating plants of Indian corn, wheat and other cereals, the first node of the stem is found near the surface of the ground, regardless of the depth at which the seed was planted. If the seed is deeply planted, the hypocotyl elongates above the seed proportionally lifting the node almost to the surface. If the seed is planted shallow, on the other hand, the node is found at about the same depth. That the checking of the elongation of the hypocotyl is due to the influence of light is strikingly shown by an experiment recently conducted in the laboratory of the Wisconsin Agricultural College. Kernels of Indian corn were planted by a number of students in galvanized iron seed pans nearly filled with garden loam, after which the pans were kept covered with close-fitting tin covers until the plantlets began to appear when the covers were removed. In all plantlets which appeared above the soil before the cover of the seed pan was removed, the first node is above the soil, as is clearly shown by the fact that this node bears the cotyledon, while in those that have since appeared, the first node is just at the surface or below it.
