The following statements, upon the basis of accepted facts, may be made as to the influence of light upon plants: 1. Light exercises a direct chemical effect upon the substances of which protoplasm is composed. 2. It stimulates protoplasm to the formation of chlorophyll, although its action is not necessary to the process, and its direct chemical effect disintegrates this substance. 3. It constitutes a source of energy, which is absorbed by the chloroplasts. 4. Absence of light constitutes a specific stimulus, calling out the various reactions of etiolation. 5. Light acts as a directive or orienting stimulus to which the plant responds by locomotory or bending movements. 6. Different portions of the spectrum are operative in producing these separate effects. If an examination is made of the facts upon which these generalizations rest, with reference to the current conceptions of phototonus, paratonic influence of light, maximum, minimum and optimum, it will be found that illumination is not necessary to the motility of protoplasm, and conversely that deprivation of light does not induce a condition of rigor, but sets up various pathological phenomena, among which is the breaking down of chlorophyll. Light does not exert a paratonic or retarding effect upon growth. Its chemical action may hinder the accumulation of somatic material however. The altered development of plants in darkness is an adaptive response which has for its purpose the elevation of the chlorophyll screen and reproductive bodies. Chemical, photosynthetic and phototropic maxima, minima and optima are so widely separated that phototonus as a term to designate the condition of a plant when acted upon by light of an optimum intensity, or of an intensity between the maxima and minima, is useless and untenable, as are also light optimum, maximum and minimum when applied in generality to the light relations of the plant.
