# learn_IT_girls_python

######Preliminary remarks
The python code in this repository has been produced as part of my participation in the Learn IT, Girl! initiative (https://www.learnitgirl.com) during spring 2019. You can find a short abstract of the project I am developing during this initiative below.
The code has been written to examine a bibliographic dataset produced as part of my research on the history of agricultural meteorology during the first half of the twentieth century. My historical research is sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Project No. 321660352).
I sincerely thank my mentor, Dr Laura Fernández Gallardo, for the support received during the Learn IT, Girl! initiative.

################ Project description
Title: Digital History with Python: Data Analysis and Machine Learning with Bibliographic References
Abstract: The project will explore how data science methods and machine learning can contribute to my historical research by examining a large bibliographic data set of publications on agricultural meteorology that appeared in the years 1900-1950. The data set is being built as part of my research project on the history of agricultural meteorology in the first half of the twentieth century (https://agriculturalmeteorology.wordpress.com). It currently contains over 3.300 entries in several languages, ranging from English to Japanese, and belonging to multiple disciplines such as meteorology, agriculture, botany, geography. The data are collected using the reference management software Zotero and can be easily exported for analysis as csv/JSON files. 

During the project I will learn: a) the basics of the Python programming language (through self-study of Z. Shaw’s ‘Learn Python the Hard Way’); b) the use of tools based on Python (e.g. Pandas and Matplotlib) to visualise and analyse my bibliographic data set and discover trends in the data (e.g. whether there was an increase in the number of publications over time, who were the most prolific authors, which were the journals that published more contributions on agricultural meteorology); c) how to apply machine learning methods to the data set publications that have an abstract available and test whether classification algorithms can reliably attribute the publications to different knowledge domains (e.g. meteorology journals vs agricultural journals vs multi-discipline journals such as ‘Nature’ and ‘Science’) by using keywords, word frequency, etc.

By applying data science, I will be able to extract information from my bibliographic data set otherwise not available through traditional historical methods. This, I believe, will give me deeper insights on how agricultural meteorology developed as an interdisciplinary research field in the first half of the twentieth century.
